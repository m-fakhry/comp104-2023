# Assignment 2

1. What are these escape characters do? Write a program to print out statements and try these escape characters to see their effects.
    - Escape characters (\n, \t, \v, \b, \a)

2. Write a C++ program that receives two **integer** values from the user. The program then should print the sum (addition), difference (subtraction), product (multiplication), quotient (division), and remainder after division (modulus). Your program must use only integers.
    - Can you explain the results it produces for all of these operations?
    - Repeat the above program but instead the program should read two **float** values from the user.
