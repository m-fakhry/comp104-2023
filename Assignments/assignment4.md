# Assignment 4

### At home
The following assignments are not required to be applied in the lab. You can check it yourself at home.

1. Write a C++ program that requests from the user a value representing the month, which is a number between 1 and 12. Then, the program prints the corresponding name of the month. For example, if the user enters 2 the program displays "February". If the number is less than 1 or greater than 12 the program displays an error message.

1. Construct a truth table for each of the following boolean expressions, showing its truth value (0 or 1) for all 4 combinations of truth values of its operands p and q.

        a. !p || q
        b. p&&q || !p&&!q
        c. (p||q) && !(p&&q)

### At Lab
The following assignments are required to be applied in the lab.

1. Write and run a program that plays the game of “Rock, paper, scissors.” In this game, two players simultaneously say (or display a hand symbol representing) either “rock,” “paper,” or “scissors.” The winner is the one whose choice dominates the other. The rules are: paper dominates (wraps) rock, rock dominates (breaks) scissors, and scissors dominate (cut) paper. Use enumerated types for the choices and for the results.

1. Write a C++ program to take a value from the user as an input week number and prints the weekday by using the switch statement.
