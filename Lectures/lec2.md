# Lecture 1

## Notes

- Declaration statements
- Data types (int, long, long int, float, double, bool, char)
- Variables and memory
- Read input from users using `cin` statement
- `cout` with different outputs.
- assignment statement (evaluate the RHS and store the value in the LHS).
- casting from higher data types to lower data types with possibility of losing values.
- The final program was something like this
<section>
  <pre><code data-trim data-noescape>
    #include < iostream >
    int  main( ) {
        int x,y,z;
        cin >> x >> y;
        z = x+y;
        cout << x << "+" << y << "=" << z;
        return 0;
    }
  </code></pre>
